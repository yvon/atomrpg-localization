# ATOM RPG - French Localization

[Cliquez ici pour la version fran√ßaise](README_FR.md)

An alternative French translation for Atom RPG, generated with Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet AI.

## About This Project

There's already an official French translation, but it's not very coherent. It's actually two separate projects that were merged without harmonization and without the work being completed.

So I'm offering my version, translated by AI. I haven't had the chance to play much yet, but from what I've seen, it seems better than the official translation. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is an excellent model for this type of work.

I should emphasize that I have a lot of respect for the people who worked on these earlier versions - this is simply an alternative option.

## Installation

1. Download the archive from [GitHub](https://github.com/yvon/atomrpg-localization/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Extract the files to a directory on your computer
3. Launch the game with the `-ldir` parameter pointing to the extracted directory

### Example for Steam

1. Right-click on ATOM RPG in your Steam library
2. Select "Properties"
3. Enter the path to the translation files in LAUNCH OPTIONS, for example:
   `-ldir "C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\atomrpg-localization-main"`

I hope this translation will improve your gaming experience!
